# Generate_Sales_Report
## Python Script generates a CSV file using Pandas

### I created a synthetic dataset to simulate sales data for a Tableau dashboard.

### The dataset contains a comprehensive range of information, including the unique order ID, the date the order was placed, detailed customer information, specifics about the products ordered, the quantity of each product, pricing details, and location data. This diverse and realistic dataset is designed to provide robust support for conducting insightful and meaningful analyses in Tableau. The dataset covers a range of 12 months.

### I utilized Python to generate the data, leveraging libraries like CSV for file handling and random for creating randomized values. I implemented a dictionary to assign specific city and state pairs for accurate geographic data. Also, I incorporated product categories to add more realism and enable granular analysis. I started by defining the column headers and creating a dictionary to store city and state pairs. Then, I used a loop to generate random data for each row, including order IDs, dates, customer information, product details, and calculated total sales. I utilized Python's CSV, random, and datetime modules to handle file operations, generate random values, and work with dates. 

### One challenge was ensuring data consistency for city and state pairs. I addressed this by using a dictionary to store predefined associations.
